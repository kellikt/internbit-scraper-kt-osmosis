# internbit-scraper-kt-osmosis
Spike Solution using Osmosis

## Installation
To install osmosis for this repo, cd into the internbit-scraper-kt-osmosis directory in terminal and run:
```
npm install osmosis --save
```

## Running the scripts / Testing
In the internbit-scraper-kt-osmosis directory, run:
```
npm run scraper
```

This will run both the scripts to scrape the websites and to test if something was scraped from those scripts. Note that currently, only the SimplyHired and WayUp scripts fully scrape the search results. Still working on the Idealist script. 

Current .json files for SimplyHired and WayUp: (Can only view the raw file for SimplyHired because of its size)
* [SimplyHired](https://github.com/radgrad/internbit-scraper-kt-osmosis/blob/master/simplyHire-results.json)
* [WayUp](https://github.com/radgrad/internbit-scraper-kt-osmosis/blob/master/wayup-results.json)
